# Accessiblity-keyboard
Mobile keyboard with accessibility design for FYP

VERSION 1.1 (After feature prototype)
This version adds the functionality of the previously designed 3 key input keyboard layout and fixes some UI concerns.

-Changed the default display view to an empty box instead of "0"
-Fixed the issue of the first character typed being replaced
-Adds some background images to the keyboards

3 Key input:
-3 Key input keyboard is now fully functional with features such as a highlighted selection box, multi tap and long press
-Fixed the UI to be clearer



VERSION 1.2
This version adds a brand new swipe design, fixes background issues and improves on some UI elements.

-Swapped the position of the caps button considering that the space and backspace buttons should be more accessible.
-Added backgrounds to the old designs and added outlines to make the buttons more visible.

Swipe keyboard:
An alternative to the 3 key input design, where instead of buttons to move the selector, the user is able to move just with swipes on the screen, tapping or holding
anywhere in the keyboard area functions as the select button.



VERSION 1.3
This version adds haptic feedback and changes some things when the caps button is pressed for visual clarity and QoL concerns.

-Haptic feedback on keypresses for accessibility concerns
-Pressing the caps button now: 1)Lights up the caps button to show activation 2)Changes all keyboard text to capital form for visual feedback



Version 1.4
This version adds yet another design, TwoTap. This keyboard allows the user to press any key with exactly two taps.

-Changed the type of touchable for row 4 to touchable opacity instead of the multitap library since touchable opacity provides better visual feedback.
-Small UI changes like borderRadius and margins to keep the overall layout more compact

TwoTap:
Very similar layout to the optimalT9, a self proposed design where the concept involves allowing the user to type any character with two keypresses
while still maintaining the 9 key design and does not require quick precise rapid taps like the other layouts.
Tapping each key rebinds the same set of 9 keys but with the options from the first keypress, such that each press "opens" a menu.
